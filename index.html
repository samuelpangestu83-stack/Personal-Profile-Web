Hello, my name is Samuel Pangestu, but you can call me Sam. I am a student at Universitas Negeri Jakarta with a strong interest in the field of programming. In my project assignments, I often use programming languages such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and C++, and I continuously strive to improve my skills by learning other programming languages. Besides studying, I also work part-time in the expedition field to gain more experience and make good use of my free time.

      on my hobby, I love to camping, hiking in the mountains, playing futsal, and many other activities that keep me active and connected with my surroundings. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also teach me about teamwork, patience, and the beauty of continuous exploration.
      Besides my hobbies, I am also very serious about learning the world of programming. I started with the basics, and although it was not always easy, I am committed to continuously improving my skills step by step. For me, programming is not just about writing code, but also about solving problems, building creativity, and training myself to think logically. I believe that with persistence and continuous learning, I can grow into someone who contributes meaningfully in the field of technology    </div>
